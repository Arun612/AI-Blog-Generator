## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- 💰 **Access to Efficient Models**: Most efficient LLMs with faster response times and better output quality (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Claude 3) required paid APIs, which constrained usage to free or community models.
- 🔄 **Tool Latency**: Search-based tools like DuckDuckGo have rate limits or slower response times on free tiers, affecting performance consistency.
- 🧪 **Content Relevance**: Extracted data from Wikipedia sometimes lacked real-time updates, affecting the freshness of content.
